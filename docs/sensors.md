## ECG (Heatbeat sensor)

![alt text](images/sensor_ecg.jpg "ECG Sensor (Heartbeat sensor)")

This is the [Pulse Sensor](https://pulsesensor.com) heartbeat sensor that can be used to visualize live heartbeats or calculate beats per minute.

### Attaching the sensor to your body

There are two common ways to attach it to your body: either use a velcro strap and attach it to one of your fingers, or clipping it to your earlobe with the  supplied clip. The latter is more prone to fall off, but is easier to use when prototyping (as it leaves your hands free for typing).
